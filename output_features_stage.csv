               future to all of you. Since our inception on 27th Sept 1999 with a paid-up capital of Rs 20 crs, IRCTC
               has made significant strides, becoming a trusted platform for railway booking online and train
               reservation online. In a span of just 20-21 years, our Market Capitalization has surpassed Rs 20,000
               Crs—a testament to the dedication of Team IRCTC and the strong foundations laid by our predecessors. This
               success is reflected in our continued growth and resilience, adapting to challenges such as the transfer
               of Catering to Railways, the withdrawal of Service charges, and our rapid expansion of online food
               service in train for the convenience of travellers. IRCTC has consistently risen to challenges, thanks to the outstanding efforts, hard work, and dedication
               of each team member. Our vision has always been to simplify travel experiences and provide comprehensive
               solutions, from railway booking online and train reservation online to railway tour packages that make
               travelling accessible for all. The introduction of railway tour packages has further diversified our
               offerings, ensuring IRCTC remains a trusted and reliable service provider. Connect With Us Connect With Us Today for the Latest Updates and Opportunities.

               future to all of you. Since our inception on 27th Sept 1999 with a paid-up capital of Rs 20 crs, IRCTC
               has made significant strides, becoming a trusted platform for railway booking online and train
               reservation online. In a span of just 20-21 years, our Market Capitalization has surpassed Rs 20,000
               Crs—a testament to the dedication of Team IRCTC and the strong foundations laid by our predecessors. This
               success is reflected in our continued growth and resilience, adapting to challenges such as the transfer
               of Catering to Railways, the withdrawal of Service charges, and our rapid expansion of online food
               service in train for the convenience of travellers. IRCTC has consistently risen to challenges, thanks to the outstanding efforts, hard work, and dedication
               of each team member. Our vision has always been to simplify travel experiences and provide comprehensive
               solutions, from railway booking online and train reservation online to railway tour packages that make
               travelling accessible for all. The introduction of railway tour packages has further diversified our
               offerings, ensuring IRCTC remains a trusted and reliable service provider. Connect With Us Connect With Us Today for the Latest Updates and Opportunities.
