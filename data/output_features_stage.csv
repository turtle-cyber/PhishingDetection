Medical records play a crucial factor in deciding the premium as well, since life insurance policies typically come with an underwriting process that includes a thorough medical exam of the policyholder. Any red flags concerning physical health and potential illnesses can have an impact on the amount of premium to be paid. Family history is important as certain hereditary diseases could be passed on to the policyholder. The family's medical history plays a part in revealing these patterns and can influence the amount of premium. Smoking and drinking, which are considered harmful to health and can impact your longevity, also influence the amount of premium to be paid. Professions and lifestyles can also impact the life insurance premium. Persons working in professions considered dangerous like mining, oil and gas and fisheries, and indulging in risk taking activities like mountaineering can attract higher premiums. 6 What types of death are not covered by life insurance? While deaths due to accidents are covered by life insurance, there are certain exceptions. Accidental death if the insured is involved in any criminal activity or if death occurs due to intoxication or drugs are not covered by term life insurance plans. Accidental deaths while the insured was engaged in adventure sports like sky diving and bungee jumping are also not covered by such plans. Death benefits for suicide are generally made at the discretion of insurance companies. Usually, beneficiaries are entitled to 80 per cent of amount accumulated from premiums paid in case of a non-linked plan, and 100 per cent in the case of a linked plan, if the insured dies by suicide within the initial 12 months. Term insurance plans do not cover death occurring from self-inflicted injuries, or due to illnesses like sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS. Death due to alcohol or drug abuse is also not covered by term plans, nor is homicide where the policy holder is murdered by the nominee for money. Death due to an existing illness that has not been disclosed at the time of purchasing the plan is also not covered by term life insurance plans. Death caused by natural disasters like tsunami, earthquake, floods etc is not covered by term insurance, unless the policy holder has opted for riders for that purpose. 7 What are the uses of life insurance?

Types of Life Insurance Let’s explore the types of life insurance as per your financial needs: 1 Term Life Insurance Term insurance is the simplest form of life insurance that provides financial protection against death for a specific period. Since term life insurance is pure life insurance its premiums are affordable. Ideally you should get a term plan as early as possible as its premiums increase with age. Along with your term insurance plan you can avail additional coverage with add-on riders, for example if you want to get critical illness insurance you can get the critical illness rider. You can also opt to get all your premiums back after the term of the policy in case you survive through term insurance with return of premium . 2 ULIPs A Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP) is a type of life insurance that combines protection with investment. With a ULIP , you get life coverage and the chance to invest in market-linked options, which can potentially increase your money over time. It also offers tax benefits as per your income tax slab and the flexibility to switch between different investment funds. A ULIP calculator helps you figure out how much coverage you need and how to split your money between insurance and investments. 3 Endowment Policy The endowment policy provide guaranteed returns and protection of life insurance. By choosing an endowment plan, you can experience extensive coverage with the opportunity to save regularly. Thus, a policyholder expects to achieve a lump sum once the policy matures. To calculate the final payout of this policy you can use the savings calculator . In case of your sudden death during the policy tenure, your nominee will be eligible for death benefits. 4 Retirement Plans A retirement plan or pension plan is an investment plan designed to ensure you’re financially secure when you retire. It lets you invest money while you’re working, building up a savings fund that you can use when you stop working. Investing in a retirement plan is a smart, disciplined way to prepare for a comfortable and worry-free retirement. 5 Child Plans Child insurance plan helps secure your child’s financial future by saving for education and marriage costs. Child plans provide maturity benefits when the child turns 18, either as a lump sum or in yearly payments. They also include insurance for parents, offering financial support if the insured parent passes away during the policy period. 6 Participating Life Insurance Plans It is a type of savings plans where you invest in a participating plan you will receive dividends and bonuses derived from the profits. These payments are usually made annually. There are several ways in which you can utilize and receive dividends and bonuses if you hold a participating policy: When the life insurance company distributes payouts, you will receive them. If you have a plan with a due premium amount, use the payouts to pay it. Make sure dividends or bonuses are deposited with the insurance company so that interest can be earned on them. These benefits are in addition to the regular maturity benefits that are guaranteed by the life insurance company. If applicable, some insurers offer terminal bonuses upon maturity along with paid-up additions. 7 Whole Life Insurance Whole life insurance provides comprehensive life insurance coverage till 100 years of age. It's also known as permanent life insurance because it offers life cover for your family when you are not around. It's a reliable way to ensure your loved ones are financially secure and to plan for your own financial goals. 8 Annuity Plans Annuity plans ensure you get regular income after you retire, helping you build savings for the future. These financial products provide steady payments throughout retirement. 9 Money back policy Money Back Policy is a type of life insurance plan that offers both life cover and regular returns during the term of the policy. It combines the benefits of life insurance and investment, providing financial protection along with steady returns at specific intervals. What are the Benefits of Life Insurance? Let’s explore the various benefits of life insurance : 01 Death Benefit Upon the demise of the policy holder the beneficiary of the policy receives a sum of money as the death benefit. Objective of death benefit is to provide financial support to the beneficiary in case of the policy holder’s absence. 02 Tax Saving Benefit Life insurance is one of the financial tools that offer dual tax benefits. For the premiums you pay, you can avail tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act 10 . Also, the maturity and death benefit are tax-free under Section 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act 10 . The GST on life insurance premiums has been reduced from 18% to 0%, with the change proposed to be effective from September 22, 2025. 03 Wealth Creation There are types of life insurance that help in wealth creation along with financial protection. Unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) and endowment plans can help grow your wealth in the long term as per your risk appetite. In the case of ULIPs, returns are linked to the markets and in the case of endowment plans the returns are guaranteed. An investment calculator can help you evaluate the estimated returns of an investment plan like ULIP or endowment plan. 04 Maturity Benefit Life insurance plans other than term life insurance offer maturity benefits at the end of the term of the policy. For example, if you get a ULIP for 15 years then at the end of 15 year you will receive the maturity benefit. 05 Rider Benefit Riders are add-ons that help enhance the financial protection provided by your base life insurance. You can choose to opt for riders for an additional premium. You can customise your requirements by opting for various riders, such as accidental death rider, waiver of premium rider, accidental disability rider, critical illness rider, etc. *T&C Apply HDFC Life Click 2 Invest *T&C Apply Minimal charges to get the most from your investments Calculate Premium HDFC Life Insurance - Customer Stories!

The main factor influencing the life insurance premiums of a policyholder is their age. Younger persons are generally considered healthy and unlikely to contract illnesses or pass away suddenly; hence younger people attract lower insurance premiums. Gender is another factor that determines the premium amount as proven scientific and statistical evidence points to women likely to live an average of 5 years more than men. Consequently, since women are perceived to avail of policies for a longer tenure, they can avail of lower premiums. Medical records play a crucial factor in deciding the premium as well, since life insurance policies typically come with an underwriting process that includes a thorough medical exam of the policyholder. Any red flags concerning physical health and potential illnesses can have an impact on the amount of premium to be paid. Family history is important as certain hereditary diseases could be passed on to the policyholder. The family's medical history plays a part in revealing these patterns and can influence the amount of premium. Smoking and drinking, which are considered harmful to health and can impact your longevity, also influence the amount of premium to be paid.

               of each team member. Our vision has always been to simplify travel experiences and provide comprehensive
